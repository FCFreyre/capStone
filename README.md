## Huddle



Huddle was designed to be a full platform for players and coaches. The current version is just a skeleton of what Huddle will ultimately be.

At it's core, Huddle is essentially an online playbook. With athletes of all ages on their phones all the time as it is, Huddle aims to help today's coaches make their plays easily accessible to their entire roster.

The aim is to eventually make Huddle an entire platform for coaches and athletes to communicate, whether it's as simple as posting the starting lineups, or as complex as a coach setting up workout plans for the entire team. Hopefully, Huddle can become all that and more.

Huddle was built with React/Redux, Express, and MongoDB.
